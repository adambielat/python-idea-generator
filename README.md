# Python Idea Generator

A very simple python idea generator, but ideas are not infinite. 
79 ideas ranging from intermediate to advanced are stored in a .csv file.
The program turns the .csv into a dataframe, an index is then randomly called using the random library.

This is just a little 5 lines that I made to help me with creativity.
